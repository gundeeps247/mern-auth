## Project Overview

The Health Matrix project leverages the Hugging Face LLM model to provide a healthcare-focused data management platform. With capabilities to process medical data, extract information, and present health insights, this platform integrates multiple features for efficient data handling in healthcare.

---

## Features

1. **User Authentication** - Sign up, log in, and manage profiles securely.
2. **File Uploads** - Upload profile pictures and PDF files for health record management.
3. **Question-Answering** - Ask health-related questions, and get answers powered by AI.
4. **Data Visualizations** - View health insights through bar charts and other visualization types.
5. **Voice-to-Text** - Use voice commands to enter questions.
6. **Past Comparisons** - View previously analyzed data for better insights.

## Project Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
   bash
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   

3. Run the frontend and backend development servers:
   bash

## Frontend

The frontend is built with **React** and uses **Redux** for state management, **Chart.js** for data visualizations, and **Firebase Storage** for file uploads. The main features of the frontend include:
- Profile management with image upload
- File (image/PDF) upload functionality with real-time feedback
- Question-answering feature powered by AI
- Voice-to-text capabilities
- Viewing data visualizations and past comparisons

---

## Backend

The backend handles user authentication, data storage, and file uploads. It provides APIs for:
- Saving user profiles and managing authentication
- Uploading and storing files (images, PDFs)
- Interacting with AI for question-answering
- Fetching and storing health insights for visualizations
